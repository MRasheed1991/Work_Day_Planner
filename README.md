## About the Project

The Task was to create a Day Planner using the jQuery and moment.js.

- When the page load the current day and time should be displayed in the top section.
- Each hour of the planner should be colour coded to see which hours are in the past, current hour and in the future.
  - Grey Color indicates hours in the "Past".
  - Red Color indicates hours in the "Present".
  - Green Color Indicates hours in the "Future"
- created textarea so the user can add text to each hour.
- The input text can be saved into the local storage.
